Stream width vs. wood length and wood orientation data for spring-fed streams in western US

This repo hosts a Jupyter notebook which contains aggregated data in the form of a python dictionary about the characteristics of 
spring-fed streams in the Western United States. Streams included in the data are:

	Reservation Spring, OR
  
	Snow Creek, OR
  
	Toms Creek, ID
  
	Cultus River, OR
  
	Browns Creek, OR
  
	Mill Creek, ID
  
	Tyler Creek,ID
  
	Billingsley Creek, ID
  
	Blue Springs, OR
  
	Spring Creek A, OR
  
	Spring Creek B, OR
  
	Fall River, OR
  
	Black Sands Creek, MT
  
	Hat Creek, CA
  
	McCloud River,CA
  
	Lost Creek, CA
  
	Big Springs Creek, CA
  
	Unnamed Spring 1, AZ
  
	Whisting Spring, AZ
  
	Unnamed Spring 2, AZ
  
	Unnamed Spring 3, AZ
  
	West Pinchot Spring, AZ
  
	Big Springs, MO
  
	Maramec Springs, MO
  
	Silver Creek, ID
  
	Crystal Castle Cr, OR
  
	Deer Creek, OR
  
	Cultus Creek, OR
  
	Moose Creek, ID
	
Data are included as follows:


	GPS: GPS location as identified using Google Earth Pro
  
	elevation: elevation at the GPS point identified using Google Earth Pro
  
	stream_width: stream width measured at about 10 cross-sections near the GPS location using Google Earth Pro
  
	wood_length: length of about 10 pieces of large woody debris found in or near the channel
  
	discharge: discharge level measured by the author specified in info_source
  
	info_source: keyword to identify source of discharge information, full citations below
  
	temp: average annual temperature at that location as measured by NOAA, full citation below
  
	MAP: mean annual precipitation at that location as measured by NOAA, full citation below
  
	snow: mean annual snowfall at that location as measured by NOAA, full citation below
  
	avg_str_wid: stream width as measured by Griffiths et al. (2008) for streams in AZ that do not contain wood
  
	wood_hist: difference in orientation from downstream direction measured up to 90 degrees since it is
              not possible to distinguish reliably between ends of LWD in Google Earth Pro
